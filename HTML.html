<H1 STYLE="COLOR:YELLOW;">Introduction:</H1>
<HR SIZE="5">
<P STYLE="font-size:25px">HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
 It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
 It consists of series of elements. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
 With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
 HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.</P>

<H2 STYLE="COLOR:GREY;">Features: </H2>
<P STYLE="font-size:50px">
<LI>User Friendly & Simple: You can write HTML using annotations called tags. Tags give HTML a structure and make it easy for humans and browsers to read the document efficiently. 
 They also enable a browser to apply CSS (Cascaded StyleSheets) to the digital document, making it a powerful visual combination..</LI>
<LI>There are new graphics elements including vector graphics and tags.</LI>
<LI>Semantic Structure: HTML5 defines unique tags to annotate different elements for their specific purposes. Enrich semantic content by including header footer, article, section and figure are added.</LI>
<LI>Canvas for Game Development: You can use HTML5 to build some simple games; however, if you’re looking to make a good video game, you can utilise the <canvas> element along with CSS and JavaScript. 
 Canvas enables you to build 2D and 3D games. You can make these games as interactive as you’d like.</LI>
<LI>Allows drawing various shapes like triangle, rectangle, circle, etc.</LI>
<LI>Capable of handling incorrect syntax.</LI>
<LI>Easy DOCTYPE declaration </LI>
<LI>Easy character encoding </LI>

<H2 STYLE="COLOR:BROWN;">Why use HTML5?</H2>
<UL>
<LI>It’s compatible across browsers: HTML5 is supported by all the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, as well as iOS for Chrome and Safari and Android browsers. It can even work with the older and less popular browsers like Internet Explorer.</LI>
<LI>It enables offline browsing: HTML5 allows you to build offline applications. Browsers that support HTML5 offline applications (which is most) will download the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources that make up the application and cache them locally..</LI>
<LI>It allows you to write cleaner code: With HTML5’s new semantic elements, you can create cleaner and more descriptive code bases. 
Before HTML5, developers had to use a lot of general elements like divs and style them with CSS to display like headers or navigation menus. The result? A lot of divs and class names that made the code more difficult to read.
HTML5 allows you to write more semantically meaningful code, which enables you and other readers to separate style and content.</LI>
<LI>It’s more accessible: Also thanks to HTML5’s new semantic elements, you can create websites and apps that are more accessible.</LI>
<LI>The most important reason to use HTML 5 is, we believe it is not going anywhere. It will be here to serve
 for a long time according to W3C recommendation.</LI>

<H2 STYLE="COLOR:PINK;">HTML vs HTML5 </H2>
<P STYLE="font-size:30px"> The difference between HTML and HTML5 are listed below:
<LI>HTML contains elaborate types of character encoding. Whereas HTML5 contains easier types of character encoding</LI>
<LI>HTML does not support audio and video without the use of a flash player. But HTML5 supports audio and video controls with the use of <audio> and <video> tags.</LI>
<LI>HTML uses browser cache memory as temporary storage. And HTML5 offers multiple storage options, such as an SQL database, application cache, and web storage.</LI>
<LI>In HTML, Programmers are unable to use features that determine a user’s geolocation. But in HTML5, it has a JavaScript geolocation API, which can be used to identify any user's location when accessing the website.</LI>
<LI>In HTML, vector graphics are supported with the help of various tools, such as Adobe Flash, VML, etc. In HTML5, vector graphics are supported by default.</LI>
